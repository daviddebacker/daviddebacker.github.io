		<h1>Unit 7 Critique</h1>

<header>Reflection:</header>

<h3>1.Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h3>

<p>The following two website has been in most inspirational: http://qz.com http://elevateapp.com</p>

<h3>2.Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h3>
<p>The minimalistic approach to the their layout and the ease in which you can navigate throughout the page has been the greatest attraction, and is why I like these two sites so much. </p>

<h3>3.What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h3>

<p>I do find the biggest challenge for me is that of trying to take my conceptual idea and putting it into the code. Having such a vivid imagine in mind, I do stumble putting it all together. </p>

 <h3>4.Which struggles did you encounter during page development ? </h3>

<p>I struggled adding multiple id's within Divs for imagines, followed by arranging the content into a column arrangement.</p> 

 <h3>5. What did you learn from making your project responsive ?  </h3>

<p>I leant that by adding a responsive element to the project, you are able to place an importance on contact and help with the flow of the page, although I do struggle with the responsive element of the page. </p>



<header>Group 1: Medium</header> 

<p>Being fairly familiar with Medium, I have often been drawn back to the site due to its layout.

Medium has broken their page into three main section. 
The content, is structured on the left of the page with a scroll function, taking the user on a trip as they scroll through the various articles. The navigation bar is presented in two layouts. The main navigation bar is set at the head of the page, used to navigate between pages on the site. The secondary Nav Bar, is set on the right of the page, which a static position this nav bar acts as a link directory, suggesting and recommending the latest trending articles and key words, thus allowing the user to switch articles, in matter how far down they scroll.

Medium has found an equilibrium between sans-serif and serif, 
with most headers in sans-serif and text content in serif. 
The use of black text and green links allows for an easy read and flow of the site. 
Medium has structured the site so that the users main attention gets attracted to the various articles first, as of each articles hero, secondly the users eye is drawn to the right hand side nav bar, through an illustration used to invite users to engage further in the site. Thirdly the users shall notice the head nav bar, which then allows the user to create an account and navigate throughout the site.</p>


<header>Group 2 : cavs.mit.edu</header>

<p>To begin, I do not like this site, I honestly feel embarrassed for the design industry seeing this site. 
I am note sure if MIT created this site as a social study for teaching purposes within their advanced visual study course. If so, they have made a good point and how not to present a website. 

The users eye is brought to the centre of the page, but then is soon lost with the clutter surrounding it. There is no structure, no flow, as for typography, the little expression of such, does enough to give any user a head ache. Just reading the home page, make me sure that I shall not click on their "Go to_"link. 

With no purpose, direction, and sheer lack of flow, this site is a great example on how not to design a website.</p>
