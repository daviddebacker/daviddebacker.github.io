			<h1 id="infohead"> Who is Dave </h1>
			<p id="Dave"> Hey there, my name is David, I am a 21 year old, born and raised in South African.
As you explore my site, I shall take you on a personal guided tour of me, my ideologies and where I am going.
In my 21 years of treading the foot paths of life, I have found myself in some remarkable places and opportunities, many of which have chiselled and crafted me into the man you read about today.
Finishing High School in 2012, I had the opportunity to leave South Africa to work abroad. I have been working in the Maritime industry ever since, until now as I am met by the rising sun on my horizon as I prepare to being a new chapter in my life.
For serval years I have been interested in technology, taking a few introductory course in High School. I have recently pursued this passion, becoming fluent in Web Design, but why stop there ? I am now taking the notorious CS50 Computer Science Course Through Harvard University, expanding my knowledge of this intriguing industry we know as the Tech World.
I hope to share some insight and guidance with you, from all I have learnt and been through so far in life. I hope you enjoy, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
I guess all that is left to say is... <br>
WELCOME !!</p>
