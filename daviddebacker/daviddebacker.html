		     <h3>Hola Mexico</h3>
		     
		     <p id="mexico"> Once again I find myself in a trendy little cafe,tucked away in a pale, grey corner building, as the sun cures the sand coated pavement outside; I find sanctuary in a worn arm chair dressed with a couple scatter cushions as the crisp cool air from the A/C meanders through the retro decor of this quaint cafe. So my Adventures have brought me to La Paz, Mexico. Which is in Baja California Sur, (Home of Los Carbos, for all your spring breakers, and the infamous Hotel Califoirnia.)
		     I have been in La Paz for a month now, to which I believe it is now fitting to share a few ventures during my stay. <br>
		     <br>
		     My arrival: <br>
		     it was around 11.25 and I had landed into Los Carbos Intl' Airport, making my way through custom, I was introduced to Mexico by a warm, friendly pocket of air that rushed to greet me as soon as the slidling doors to baggage collection opened, it was a warm 34'C (93'F). The festivites began as soon as I exited the aipport building as I walked into the shuttle zone, which was filled by two bars, either side of the enterance to the aiprort building, meeting my driver he promoted the idea of having a drink at the bar, before to disembark on our mammoth 3 hour trip to La Paz.  
<br>
             I am not one for sterotypes, but if you ever had any preconsived idea of what Mexico would be like, astetically or socially, you are most liekly right ? Amoungst the dry, desile landscape, one shall become capivated with the sheer amount of catuses petuding out from the waterless soil. It is rather mesmarising to be honest, well then again, I can describe time here as mesmaroizing. From Breathtaking to Sunset Mexico has a color palet to be rivied, hues of organge, red and pink illuminate the skyline and bring to life the dull, dry landscape.
